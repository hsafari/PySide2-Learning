# PySide2-Learning
A collection of short examples for learning PySide2

>Getting Started:

You will need to follow the installation instructions given on PySide2: https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2_GettingStarted

#Windows:

You can compile the package yourself as described here: https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2_GettingStarted/Windows
Or just install it via `conda` (this will involve getting Anaconda) using:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda install pyside2
    
Everything is numbered.  So start at 1 and work your way up on the different files.  The comments explain what each part of the code is doing.  Good Luck! :)
